# About Me

I have been 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐞 about technology since childhood, and my curiosity has driven me to learn and understand various aspects of the tech world through self-study.  
Over the years, I have gained work experience and training in different areas related to technology, allowing me to develop a solid and versatile knowledge base.

Currently, my focus is on 𝐜𝐲𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲. I am particularly interested in the 𝐁𝐮𝐠 𝐁𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐲 world, and my goal is to specialize in creating secure and ethical applications.
